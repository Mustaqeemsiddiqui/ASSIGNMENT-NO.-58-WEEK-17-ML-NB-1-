    "1. **Medical Diagnosis**: Bayes' theorem helps calculate the probability of a disease given certain symptoms. Doctors can update their diagnosis based on new test results and prior probabilities of diseases.\n",

    "3. **Document Classification**: In natural language processing, Bayes' theorem is used in naive Bayes classifiers to categorize documents based on the occurrence of words and their probabilities in different categories.\n",

    "   - **Assumption**: Assumes features are counts that follow a multinomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "   - **Data Type**: Suitable for binary or boolean features, where each feature represents presence or absence of a particular attribute.\n",
    "   - **Assumption**: Assumes features are binary-valued (0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand Your Data**: Determine the type of features you have (continuous, discrete, binary).\n",
    "- **Evaluate Assumptions**: Assess whether the independence assumption of Naive Bayes holds reasonably well for your data. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes can perform well in practice even when the independence assumption is not strictly met, but this depends on the dataset.\n",
    "- **Domain Knowledge**: Consider domain-specific knowledge about the problem and the relationships between features.\n",
